1c. All variables are numeric, and there are no null values. 
At this point, without domain knowledge of which of these variables might affect alchohol content,
 all variables seem suitable for regression analysis, except for quality, 
as this is a discrete (non-continuous) and subjectively determined varaible. Quality would be suitable for a classification analysis though.

2a. White is a strong positive correlation (1) and black is a strong negative correlation (-1). 
Strong positive or negative correlations are worth investigating. For instance, fixed acidity and density are strongly positively correlated.
